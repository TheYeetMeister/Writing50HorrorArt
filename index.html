                Photography gallery with certain filters and editing 
                to create dark and formless images that are meant to 
                take relatively mundane and average photos and twist them 
                into obscurity and twist the colors and lines to make normality
                into depravity. These images depict ideas of Family, security, 
                the great beyond, or ideas of the human mind and play with them 
                in a way as to reveal, and exaggerate imperfections or flaws in 
                otherwise safe or normal environments. The overall purpose of this 
                art gallery is to shift the perspective of how people may see things or 
                places, revealing to people the fear of the unknown, or shedding fear 
                on what they thought they knew. I drew heavy inspiration from Laura Zalenga's "G O P L E", and 
                Brian Somerville's "The visionary" as I framed my photos much like Laura Zalenga would photograph things
                with somewhat mundane or simple scenarios, besides a few photos, I attempted to try
                and make the photos relatively normal or mundane, while somerville's artistic skills
                took those relatively simple concepts and ideas and twisted them in creepy ways, as he added
                symbols on his art, I changed the line weight and shading of my photos to give off a sureal
                or off puttting atmosphere much like Somerville.
