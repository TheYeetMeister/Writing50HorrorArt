        <h1>Welcome To My Website About Horror!</h1>
        <p>
            Photography gallery with certain filters and editing 
            to create dark and formless images that are meant to 
            take relatively mundane and average photos and twist them 
            into obscurity and twist the colors and lines to make normality
            into depravity. These images depict ideas of Family, security, 
            the great beyond, or ideas of the human mind and play with them 
            in a way as to reveal, and exaggerate imperfections or flaws in 
            otherwise safe or normal environments. The overall purpose of this 
            art gallery is to shift the perspective of how people may see things or 
            places, revealing to people the fear of the unknown, or shedding fear 
            on what they thought they knew.
