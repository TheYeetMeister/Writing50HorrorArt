            <img src="../artwork/slouched_bathroom.jpg" alt="image of a person in a room slouching over praying to something on the wall with a figure on the otherside">
            <p>
                This artwork depicts a person, 
                perhaps a spirit, creature, or intruder 
                slouching down on the floor facing what appears to 
                be a towel, with the towel casting a shadow and a light 
                or figure can be seen on the towel. The muted colors and 
                rough outlines let the audience fill in the blanks of what 
                the colors and room may actually look like from a 
                realistic perspective, leaving room for the audience's imagination 
                to run wild while also leaving many unknown factors for the audience 
                to attempt to answer. The environment of the artwork appears to be taking 
                place in a room in a home, most likely a bathroom as the towel rag and circular 
                like object at the bottom, which appears to be a toilet or a small table, hints 
                at the fact that the piece of art takes place in the bathroom. The overall image 
                appears to give a eerie, or creepy aura, as what was once considered a safe area, 
                as the bathroom is where people require much privacy, is invaded by a human-like 
                creature that appears to be attempting to communicate to something, as the 
                towel appears to act as a window to somewhere else with a figure present at 
                the otherside of the towel. This artwork appears to play off the audience 
                insecurity as what was once considered a safe haven appears to be invaded 
                by two creatures, the creature slouching and the figure on the other side 
                of the towel, and with not much known about the situation or just what is 
                on the other side of the towel the audience is left to guess at what has entered the home.
