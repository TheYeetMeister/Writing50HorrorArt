            <img src="../artwork/etheral_sea.jpg" alt="image of a ladder extending up and down with an animal present at the ladder, the shadows appear to be growing">
            <p>
                This image illustrates an ocean-like environment 
                with a ladder that seems to extend to as far as 
                the sky to as deep as the bottom of an abyss that 
                appears to be alive, with a shark-like creature sitting 
                at the base of the ladder appearing to block whatever 
                attempts to cross the ladder. The muted colors disconnects 
                the audience from the art as it doesn't allow the audience 
                to imagine what the colors of the environment would actually 
                be, nor does it allow the audience to easily deduce nor figure 
                out what the creature beside the ladder is, the muted colors 
                hides many details of the environment leaving the audience with 
                an unknown factor about the environment. The overall image gives 
                off a feeling of fear of the unknown as the environment appears 
                to be unfamiliar, and the shadows near the bottom of the image 
                appear to be alive and reaching out, making the audience wonder 
                if the shadow of the abyss in the image is actually alive and is 
                maybe trying to grab the creature near the ladder, this leaves the 
                audience fearing for the creatures safety as it may be caught by the 
                clutches of an abyss that may have a mind of its own. This artwork 
                plays heavily on the audience's fear of the unknown, as the audience 
                has no idea what or where this environment is, as it can be somewhere 
                as deep as the deep dark sea, perhaps in the mountains, or in a great beyond 
                the audience can't quite comprehend, and the encroaching darkness may possess 
                intelligence and a will of its own.
