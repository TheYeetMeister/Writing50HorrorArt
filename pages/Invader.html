                This image illustrates a deep dark sea in the middle of a 
                desolate land, with what appears to be creatures that are 
                turtle-like existing at the bottom of the sea. This depicts 
                an unnatural glowing ooze in the lake as well as shadows 
                that appear to be grabbing, corporeal, and ethereal, this 
                evokes a feeling of awe at what there is, but also a feeling 
                of fear as it is unknown of what the forms and feelings of 
                the creatures that exist in this ethereal pool of glowing ooze. 
                The line work of this artwork also appears to depict the rocks 
                or shadows to be alive, with shadows of other creatures like 
                ducks existing in this swamp, the lighter line work of these 
                rocks or ducks makes them appear ghostlike as if they exist in 
                another plane of existence altogether that the audience can't 
                quite comprehend. This artwork plays heavily onto the audience's 
                fear of the unknown, as the swamp appears to be ethereal and ghost 
                like, while the surroundings appear hellish, as if this artwork is 
                a depiction of the afterlife, or more accurately hell, and is perhaps 
                trying to warn the audience of what may be instore past their lives.
