                This image depicts a teddy bear 
                slouching over and staring at several photos on a 
                window sill. The darkened lighting and lack of colors 
                gives off a feel of history or something old, as if the 
                drawing or photo exists in the past. The overall image feels 
                homely and comfortable as the items and environment appear 
                to be something out of an ordinary home, but the colors and 
                position of the teddy bear and pictures gives off a feeling of 
                distance, not a distance of space but of time, as if the 
                audience is looking at the image through a TV or distance memory 
                as the lines of the image are rough mimicking TV static or the 
                numerous holes that exist in the minds of humans. This piece of art 
                ties into the idea of the family by depicting how many family members 
                look at the good old times, many people look back at their lives or 
                families through a lens whether that be nostalgia or sentimentality, 
                many look back on what they once was with imperfections in their memories 
                in fear or regret at what they have become. The teddy bear is most likely a 
                representation of these people, as Teddy Bears are what kids bring everywhere
                 and are something children are very close with, with the Bear now 
                 alone and looking back what once was parallels with how 
                 people look back at their past and their families.
